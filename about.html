				<h1>Our Inspiration: Laurie Frick</h1>
			</div>
			<p> Laurie Frick is a data artist exploring the bumpy future of data captured about us. We're halfway through the decade when humans shift from mysterious beings - to big data algorithms, where everything about us will be known. Rather than worry, Frick envisions a time when personal data is a unique glimpse into our hidden personality. Patterns of behavior will become patterned artworks and the mass of data will predict our lives.</p>
			<p>Will it backfire? Our movements, choices, health - even the food we ingest will be anticipated. How will it feel when self-delusion and forgetting become impossible? Using her background in high-technology Frick creates physical works that imagine this completely wired 'data-selfie' future.</p>
			<p>She holds an MFA from the New York Studio School, an MBA from the University of Southern California and studies at New York University's ITP program. Frick recently was awarded residencies by Samsung Research and the Neuroscience Research Center University of Texas. Frick's talks and publications include The Atlantic, Nature Publishing, Los Angeles Times, Haaretz, New Scientist, NPR, Creative Mornings and TEDx. FRICKbits 'your data is now art on your phone' was crowdfunded with a successful Kickstarter campaign and is now in the iPhone store. She has exhibited widely, with solo shows in New York, California and Texas. She is represented by Edward Cella gallery in Los Angeles, and Pavel Zoubok in New York.</p>
